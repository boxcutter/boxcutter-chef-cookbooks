This repo contains automation used to maintain a fleet of robots using
neuromorphic sensors and their supporting infrastructure. It is built
on top of the attribute-driven API cookbooks maintained by
Meta/Facebook. For more information about this style of writing automation
code, refer to the [Facebook Cookbooks Suite README](https://github.com/facebook/chef-cookbooks/blob/main/README.md).
